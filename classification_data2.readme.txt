210 instances. 7 attributes. 3 classes.

To construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured: 
1. area A, 
2. perimeter P, 
3. compactness C = 4*pi*A/P^2, 
4. length of kernel, 
5. width of kernel, 
6. asymmetry coefficient 
7. length of kernel groove. 
All of these parameters were real-valued continuous.


NOTE: This data set requires preprocessing before it can be used. Alignment is inconsistent between attributes.
